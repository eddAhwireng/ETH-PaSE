              <h2>COVID 19 IS REAL</h2>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Coronaviruses are a large family of zoonotic viruses that cause illness 
                ranging from the common cold to severe respiratory diseases. Zoonotic means these viruses are able to be 
                transmitted from animals to humans. There are several coronaviruses known to be circulating in different 
                animal populations that have not yet infected humans. COVID-19 is the most recent to make the jump to human infection.

                humans. There are several coronaviruses known to be circulating in different animal populations that have not yet 
                infected humans. COVID-19 is the most recent to make the jump to human infection.
               </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Common signs of COVID-19 infection are similar to the common cold and include respiratory 
                symptoms such as dry cough, fever, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can 
                cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death.

                The COVID-19 infection is spread from one person to others via droplets produced from the respiratory system of infected 
                people, often during coughing or sneezing. According to current data, time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually 
                between two and 14days, with an average of five days.

              <p style="text-align: justify;">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring 
                special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory 
                disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
                The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. 
                Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
                The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, 
                so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).                
                At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating 
                potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available so stay informed

              <p style="text-align: justify;">WHO is bringing the world’s scientists and global health professionals 
                together to accelerate the research and development process, and develop new norms and standards to 
                contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and help care for those affected.
                The R&D Blueprint has been activated to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for 
                this novel coronavirus.                 
                The solidarity of all countries will be essential to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 health products.
               </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">WHO is gathering the latest international multilingual scientific findings and 
                knowledge on COVID-19. The global literature cited in the WHO COVID-19 database is updated daily (Monday through Friday) 
                from searches of bibliographic databases, hand searching, and the addition of other expert-referred scientific articles. 
                This database represents a comprehensive multilingual source of current literature on the topic. While it may not be 
                exhaustive, new research is added regularly
